# Export nlds & gsfs to TALYS

Here we give an example on how to convert *arbirary* nld and gsf to fileformats readable by talys [as of October 2019] & how to use them. Thanks to Ann-Cecilie @cecgresonant for helping me in compiling this information.

- Use `convert_talys` to convert your nuclear level density and gsf to file formats readable
  by talys.
- The gsf files can be loaded using the `E1file` and `M1file` keywords in TALYS. Remember to
  set `gnorm` to one, otherwise they will be renormalized. An examples if you want to use
  the gsf of `240Pu` (e.g. in `239Pu + n`).
  ```
  # Gamma strength: tables for the E1 and M1 components
  E1file 94 240 path/to/gsfE1.dat
  M1file 94 240 path/to/gsfM1.dat
  gnorm 1.
  ```
- For the nlds, you it will be a bit more *hacky*:
  - Find the nld file for your nucleus, somewhere like
    `/talys/structure/density/ground/goriely/Pu.tab`. Make a backup of it.
  - Exchange the section of the table for the final nucleus of interest with the section in
    `nld_totalys.txt`.
  - To use them in talys, select `ldmode 4` (corresponds to the `goriely` folder) **and**
    specify explicity, that these number shall not be changed with `ptable` and `ctable`:
    ```
    ldmodel 4
    ptable 94 240 0.0
    ctable 94 240 0.0

    ```
  - Remember to use a number of levels that matches with the nld you input before
    In the example data, the nld was just given down to ~1.3 MeV, as we use(d) discrete
    levels below. One could state to use the first, say 10 levels (arb. choice in the text
    here)
    ```
    Nlevels 94 240 10
    ```
- Finally, you should always make sure that all formats were read correctly. I don't exactly
  recall which of these keywords you need, but you might just as well use all of them
  ```
  outbasic y
  outomp y
  outlevels y
  outdensity y
  outgamma y
  ```
  Then you might want to copy out and plot the nld and gsfs that talys uses. It's in the output file somewhere like
  ```

    Ex     a    sigma   total   JP=  0.0  JP=  1.0  JP=  2.0  JP=  3.0  JP=  4.0  JP=  5.0  JP=  6.0  JP=  7.0  JP=  8.0

   and the gsf (now in units of 1/MeV^3 again, not mb/MeV)
